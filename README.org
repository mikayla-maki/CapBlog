Portland State University

*** TODO [#A] Get Mikayla's hacking environment set up

 - [ ] Install Emacs
 - [ ] Install Racket
 - [ ] Install racket-mode
 - [ ] docs.racket-lang.org, go through *at least* one of the top
   tutorials
 - [ ] Read Goblins docs and install Goblins

*** TODO [#A] Create a project plan

**** Deliverables

Create a "real" version of the blog example with:
 - Read-only web view
   - Uses http capabilities and html rendering
 - Updating
   - Updating can be done manually with REPL just fine
   - Need to have "permalink" sturdyrefs for editing
 - Extensibility
   - User 1 creates blog, provides edit access over CapTP to User 2
   - User 2 creates extension (without User 1's involvement)
     with multiple stakeholder cooperation, hands access to Users 3
     and 4
   - User 3 authors and updates post to User 4's satisfaction
   - User 4 presses go-live
 - Demonstration with 4 actual users pulling off above process
   (all updating steps okay to happen at REPL)
 - BONUS: Secure persistence (use Aurie)
